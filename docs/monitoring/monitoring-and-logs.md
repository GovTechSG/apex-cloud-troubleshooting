# Monitoring and logs

This section provides steps for API publishers on  reviewing the logs in the Elastic Cloud deployment to troubleshoot any API request issues.

In Elasticsearch, the correlation ID and the stack trace are both used to help developers diagnose and resolve issues that may arise when using the system.


These data views contain data stored in Elastic as *documents*. You can check the documents to. To narrow down the data further, additonal filters can be applied to these views.


There are two ways to troubleshoot in the Elastic Cloud deployment:

- [General Troubleshooting](#general-troubleshooting.md) - Use these steps to do a gene
- [Common Issues](#common-issues.md)
